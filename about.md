Premium markups, quality issues, geo-discrimination, overwhelming choice - we believe that online shopping is broken. 
So we decided to build a company to fix that.

We gather product data from various sources, then analyze it using AI,
enabling shoppers to quickly find and order what they need, while being confident that they get a great offer. We aim at combining the largest product selection
with tools to make personalized choice hassle-free, safe and fast.


Le Club fully embraces remote work and puts people over processes. We are funded and currently busy gathering feedback on our MVP from private beta testers.
