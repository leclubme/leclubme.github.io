### About us üìñ

Premium markups, quality issues, geo-discrimination, overwhelming choice - we believe that shopping is broken. 
So we decided to build a company to fix that. We gather product data from various sources, then analyze it using AI,
enabling shoppers to quickly find and order what they need, while being confident that they get a great offer. We aim at combining the largest product selection
with tools to make personalized choice hassle-free, safe and fast.

We are a funded eCommerce startup that fully embraces remote work and puts people over processes. Our MVP is currently in a private beta.

We are looking for a Marketing Advisor to help us plan monthly and weekly marketing activities.
